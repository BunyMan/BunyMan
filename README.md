- 👋 Hi, I’m @BunyMan,
- 👀 I’m interested in AI (although I still haven't coded anything in that regard) and cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and will start C++ soon, python is my jam
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, as long as it is code related I'm in and willing to help
- 📫 You can send me an email @ jpbuny@gmail.com and I'll answer as soon as I see it!
